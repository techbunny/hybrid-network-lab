# There will be proper documentation here at some point. Promise.

But for now, there are three sections to this repo:

1. K8Sdeployments - simple examples off stuff I use when I need some application to run.
2. TFdeployments - each folder is different Terraform deployment for infrastructure.
3. TFmodules - various modules used by the deployments in the other folder.

I build my deployment projects under *TFdeployments* and generally reuse the modules under *TFmodules* however as Terraform releases new versions, some of the modules are more up-to-date than others or have evolved to support more complex processing, in which case older projects that use them may not run without requiring updates.
